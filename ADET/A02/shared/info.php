                <p class="ms-auto text-light">Brainrot Wiki is an encyclopedia that aims to document
                    and archive the various aspects of the Italian Brainrot phenomenon. It serves as a platform for fans
                    to
                    explore more knowledge, theories, and interpretations of the Italian Brainrot universe.</p>

                <p class="ms-auto text-light">
                    Italian Brainrot is a humorous and absurdist internet meme subculture that parodies exaggerated
                    Italian stereotypes using chaotic audio, surreal humor, and nonsensical phrases like “tung tung tung
                    tung sahur.” Popular across platforms such as TikTok, YouTube, and Twitter (now X), these memes are
                    known for their sensory overload—often involving fast cuts, distorted sounds, and bizarre imagery.</p>

                   <p class="ms-auto text-light"> A signature element of Italian Brainrot is the use of AI-generated images, which add to the surreal
                    and uncanny aesthetic. These often depict warped "Italian" characters—complete with giant mustaches,
                    chef hats, or exaggerated hand gestures—designed to look hilariously offbeat and weirdly expressive.
                    The images are intentionally over-the-top and unrealistic, enhancing the disorienting vibe of the
                    meme format.</p>

                    <p class="ms-auto text-light">Despite the name, Italian Brainrot has little to do with actual Italian culture. Instead, it thrives
                    on randomness, chaos, and a form of comedy that is so unhinged it borders on nonsense. The term
                    "brainrot" itself refers to the feeling of mental decay after watching too many of these videos,
                    which are often packed with visual and auditory clutter meant to confuse and amuse at the same time.
