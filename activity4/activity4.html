        <h1>Nintendo Switch OLED</h1>
        <div class="paragraph">
            <p class="mid-paragraph">The Nintendo Switch OLED is an upgraded version of the original Nintendo
                Switch,
                featuring a vibrant
                7-inch OLED display that delivers deeper colors, richer contrast, and enhanced visual clarity.
                This model is perfect for handheld gaming, with its slimmer bezels and vivid screen that brings
                games to
                life. It also includes improved audio for both handheld and tabletop modes, making gaming even more
                immersive.<br><br>

                <b>The system has 64GB of internal storage, double that of the original model,
                    allowing for more games and
                    media to be stored directly on the device. The dock has also been enhanced with a wired LAN port
                    for
                    more
                    stable online play when in TV mode. The adjustable wide stand provides better support and
                    flexibility,
                    offering more comfortable viewing angles during tabletop play.</b><br><br>

                Despite the upgraded features, the Nintendo Switch OLED maintains compatibility with all previous
                Nintendo
                Switch games and accessories, keeping the same versatility that allows players to switch between
                handheld,
                tabletop, and docked modes effortlessly. It's a sleek and polished upgrade ideal for both new users
                and
                those seeking an enhanced portable gaming experience.
